//Program Rock.java contains a skeleton for the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. 
//Add statements to the program as 
//indicated by the comments so that the program asks the user to enter a play, 
//generates a random play for the computer, compares them and announces the 
//winner (and why). For example, one run of your program might look like this:
//$ java Rock
//Enter your play: R, P, or S
//Computer play is S
//Rock crushes scissors, you win!

public class Rock {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String personPlay; // User's play -- "R", "P", or "S"
		String computerPlay; // Computer's play -- "R", "P", or "S"
		int computerInt; // Randomly generated number used to determine computer's play

		// Get person's play -- note that this is stored as a string
			
		// Make person's play uppercase for ease of comparison
				
		// Generate computer's play (0,1,2)
				
		// Translate computer's randomly generated play to string using a switch statement

		// Print computer's play
		
		// Print who won. Use nested ifs instead of &&.
